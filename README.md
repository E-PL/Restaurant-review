#### _Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I have incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I have taken a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I have also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

Udacity provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. The code is now updated to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
